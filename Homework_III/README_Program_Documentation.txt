What does HOMEWORK3_1140056 do?

	* The program reads the companion file videos.txt
	  containing video contents of various kind and 
	  loads them in a Playlist, which is equipped with
	  functionalities such as
		
		_ Next:              to reproduce the next content in the
		                     playlist
                             
		_ Rewind:            playlist is reproduced by its first
				             content
		                     
		_ HasMoreContent:    tells wether are there more 
						     contents in the playlist
						  
		_ GetCurrentContent: returns the currently playing content
		
	 Furthermore, the program divides the contents according to
	 their kind in three new playlists and saves them in a *.dat 
	 file, one for each kind of content.
	 
	* The companion file is to be saved in the Data/Source directory.
	  Once exectued, Main_11540056.exe creates a new directory Data/Drop
	  where the new files are stored, the global playlist and the three
	  subdivided playlists. 
	  
	* NOTE: Data/Drop is present yet, but it is possible to delete it, and
	  once run, the program re-creates it, with the desired files.
