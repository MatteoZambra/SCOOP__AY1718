# Assignments for the Course _Scientific Computing and Object Oriented Programming_

### Purpose of this repo
Since I still have no professional achievements, this samples are intended to give an idea of my work, my mental setting and so forth.

### Course held at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) for the [Mathematical Engineering](https://www.unipd.it/en/mathematical-engineering) MSc programme.

In a nutshell, this course was intended to give the students a primer in the C# programming language. Other than merely C# practice, the course comprehended a module in which some basics of Machine Learning and Data Mining were presented. This latter was thought to be hands-on. A final project was to be carried out in groups, with the aim to test students' confidence with C# language in real world scenarios, in this case each group was asked to choose a data set and perform some mining on it, coding the software from scratch with the possibility to use external libraries for the ML tasks (e.g. the [Accord.NET framework](http://accord-framework.net/)).

The final grade was made up by averaging homework grades, written exam and final project, this latter being heavier in terms of importance.

**Important**: as said, Final project was a team work. In the report all of the members are listed, I am thankful to the rest of the team for the support and help in the process.


### Contents

Each folder contains sources alongside with assignments and eventual companion files. Final project folder, contains solely sources and two folders: input and output. Whilst HWs were coded with a simple text editor (Notepad++) and compiled with the `mono` C# compiler, final project codes were crafter using Visual Studio 2017 Community edition, hence the folders architecture is slightly come complex. These contain, among other things, all of the dependencies to run the program, from the aforementioned framework (listed in the Readme.txt). The folder architecture is not respected, only sources and the report are present.
