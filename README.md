# Assignments for the Course _Scientific Computing and Object Oriented Programming_

### Course held at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) for the [Mathematical Engineering](https://www.unipd.it/en/mathematical-engineering) MSc programme.

In a nutshell, this course was intended to give the students a primer in the C# programming language. Other than merely C# practice, a module in which some basics of Machine Learning and Data Mining were presented was also included in the whole topics landscape. This latter was though to be hand-on. The final grade of the whole exam indeed was calculated as weighted average of the written exam, homeworks and final project, to be carried out in groups. In this final project a data set was chosen by the group members and some mining had to be performed on it, coding the ML/Mining software from scratch with the possibility to use external libraries for the ML tasks (e.g. the [Accord.NET framework](http://accord-framework.net/)).
