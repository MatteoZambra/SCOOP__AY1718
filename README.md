# Assignments for the Course _Scientific Computing and Object Oriented Programming_

### Purpose of this repo
Simply put, since I can not pound on my chest with some prior professional experience (still got any), this samples are intended to give an idea of my work, my mental setting and so forth.

### Course held at the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) for the [Mathematical Engineering](https://www.unipd.it/en/mathematical-engineering) MSc programme.

In a nutshell, this course was intended to give the students a primer in the C# programming language. Other than merely C# practice, a module in which some basics of Machine Learning and Data Mining were presented was also included in the whole topics landscape. This latter was though to be hand-on. The final grade of the whole exam indeed was calculated as weighted average of the written exam, homeworks and final project, to be carried out in groups. In this final project a data set was chosen by the group members and some mining had to be performed on it, coding the ML/Mining software from scratch with the possibility to use external libraries for the ML tasks (e.g. the [Accord.NET framework](http://accord-framework.net/)).


### Contents

Each folder contains sources alongside with assignments and eventual companion files. Final project (soon added) folder, contains solely sources and two folders: input and output. Whilst HWs were coded with a simple text editor (Notepad++) and compiled with the `mono` C# compiler, final project codes were crafter using Visual Studio 2017 Community edition, hence the folders architecture is slightly come complex. These contain, among other things, all of the dependencies to run the program, from the aforementioned framework (listed in the Readme.txt). The folder architecture is not respected, only sources and the report are present.

**Important**: as said, Final project was a team work. In the report all of the members are listed.
